* Title - set current title/project on supporting services
* Status - set status/mood on supporting services
* Tags - set tags on supporting services
* Announce - send announcement on supporting services

* User.Mod - change profile for existing user
* Cmd.Add - add new command
* Cmd.Del - delete existing command
