# Unified command line interface into community services

Since everything involves a command line message interface, we will consider the major community method of interaction to be by speakable, easy to type commands from *any* service provider that can otherwise send a message. Then, RBAC can be applied to the members of the community allowing them direct control over different elements of the stream state (views, alerts, mods, bitrate, etc). Most importantly, this will unify any bot that could ever be needed into a single, centralized, customizable bot.
