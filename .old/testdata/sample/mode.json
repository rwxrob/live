  "description": "The throbbing forehead vein is because when I code I'm usually in a pretty intense state and focused. There's a good chance I won't see your chat messages for up to 11 minutes at a time and when I do I'm less prone to answer them unless they are related to what I'm coding. See something wrong or just stupid? Please let me know. Questions are okay, but please don't expect a lot of narration or \"rubber ducking\" because I need all the brain power I can muster. Also avoid posting emotes and other distractions.",
